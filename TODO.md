- Loop through all the nodes at depth D, a method for trie,
- Divide and conquer for decoding a single element from a batch
- Python interface, by exposing directly the decoder class
- LM, lexicon, hotwords support
- For hotword, update the weight asper length from python side,
    and create WFST for the arcs
